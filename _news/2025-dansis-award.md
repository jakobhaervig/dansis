Simone Minniti wins this year's DANSIS graduate award for his thesis "A steady-state solver for wave structure interaction applications".

Again this year we had many very qualified contributions for the graduate award. The winner of 2025 did detailed FEM simulations to study the interaction between a surface and a submerged body.
We congratulate Simone Minniti with the award and thank all the candidates who have sent in their thesis for consideration for the award.
