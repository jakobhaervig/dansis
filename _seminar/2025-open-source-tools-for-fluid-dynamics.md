Open source software tools are widely used both in academia and industry as alternatives or supplement to commercial closed source software. For academia, open source is in line with its wider ethos of free and open knowledge sharing and comprises a key element to ensure reproducibility of research results. For industries, open source software can significantly reduce costs of using, maintaining and developing software as well as increase flexibility and prevent vendor lock in. For both industry and academia, open source software provides a platform for common and shared research and development, pooling resources and fostering collaboration between the two. Within fluid dynamics there exists a myriad of open source tools for both experimental and numerical work. The perhaps best example is the OpenFOAM toolbox for computational fluid dynamics simulations, which is used by thousands of researchers and engineers all over the world. In this seminar we will see examples of specific usages of open source software in industry and academia. Besides from the specific examples, presenters have been asked to reflect on what the availability of open source solutions means for their specific domain of work.

| Time  |                        |
| ----- | ---------------------- |
| 09:30 | **Registration and Coffee** |
| 10:00 | **Welcome and presentation of seminar** <br> *Johan Rønby, RUC/STROMNING* |
| 10:15 | **OpenFOAM CFD at Vattenfall** <br> *Erik Lillberg & Nicolas Edh, Vattenfall*  <br> |
| 10:45 | **Coffee break** |
| 11:00 | **Paraview with a Twist! Kitware open source software for CFD and DEM engineers** <br> *Mathieu Westphal, Kitware* <br> ParaView is the main scientific visualisation software for many simulation code and used by many. Newer version of ParaView contains tons of new feature yet to be used to their full potential. Discover how Kitware and ParaView can help you analyse your CFD and DEM results with millions of particles using advanced techniques like temporal particle tracing or customized glyphing!|
| 11:30 | **An OpenFOAM Library for the Implicit, Coupled Solution of Flows at All Speeds on CPUs and GPUs** <br> *Federico Piscaglia, Politecnico di Milano* <br> This talk presents the development of an implicitly coupled solution procedure for the Navier–Stokes equations, implemented as external library modules within the OpenFOAM framework. A novel mesh addressing scheme has been introduced to enable the seamless assembly of a virtual block-coupled matrix, represented internally as a large scalar matrix. This approach ensures efficient data organization, reduced memory footprint, and full compatibility with OpenFOAM’s existing non-symmetric algebraic solvers and operators, while also enabling efficient offloading of the linear system solution to GPUs. The scheme forms the foundation for a new family of implicit, coupled solver modules: incompressibleCoupledFluid, compressibleCoupledFluid, and shockCoupledFluid. Validation spans a wide range of flow regimes, from incompressible conditions to high-Mach and high-enthalpy flows typical of atmospheric re-entry and supersonic combustion in scramjet engines. |
| 12:00 | **Lunch break** |
| 13:00 | **DANSIS graduate Award 2025 ceremony and presentation** |
| 13:20 | **Challenges of GPU Integration into OpenFOAM** <br> *Henning Scheufler, NeoN project member* <br> The rapidly evolving hardware landscape, driven by advances in AI, creates new opportunities to accelerate CFD workflows through GPU computing. Yet, the significant differences between GPU and CPU architectures make efficient integration into existing frameworks a non-trivial challenge. This talk discusses three integration strategies, outlining their respective strengths and limitations. The NeoN project aims to overcome these challenges by introducing a new architecture designed for modularity, scalability, and interoperability. The current status of the project is described, and its long-term vision is outlined. |
| 13:50 | **Simulation of liquid metal flows - the role of open-source tools from physical understanding to industrial applications** <br> *Lilla Koloszar, von Karman Institute* <br> Liquid metal flows differ from other fluids more than just that they are usually rather hot. Their low Prandtl number makes them excellent coolants, their low viscosity provokes highly turbulent flows, and their opaque nature prohibits the usage of many measurement techniques used in common fluids such as air and water. Therefore, numerical analysis is a key tool to study the nature of such fluid flows to investigate engineering applications in the design and operation phases. However, numerical tools are usually not extended to handle liquid metals in practically relevant scale, when it comes to heat and mass transfer. The role of (open-source) CFD tools therefore is twofold: Highly scalable academic codes are needed to perform high-fidelity simulations for model development (such as the closing term of turbulent heat flux) and open-source general CFD tools are favorable where these new models can be implemented. This talk will describe this methodology through the support of a nuclear reactor design cooled by liquid metal. |
| 14:20 | **Coffee break** |
| 14:40 | **Tracking Irregular Particles in Motion: A Modular Approach with Open Source Tools** <br> *Simon Eberhard, DTU* <br> The translation and rotation of irregularly shaped particles in fluids plays a central role in many industrial and environmental processes — from sediment transport to material sorting. This talk presents a new computer vision-based method for tracking both the position and orientation of irregular particles from experimental data. The method combines computational techniques, including geometry handling, linear algebra, and optimization, all combined using open-source libraries. The availability of mature, well-documented open-source tools accelerates development and encourages experimentation without the need for deep specialization in each underlying field. Additionally, large language models (LLMs) further streamline the prototyping process by acting as guides across these tools. This talk aims to share some technical insights of the method but also the practical benefits of an open, modular, and AI assisted development workflow. |
| 15:10 | **Code_Saturne: An overview of (another) powerful Open-Source CFD solver developed over decades** <br> *Maxime Gueguin, Simvia* <br> Code_Saturne is EDF’s open-source finite-volume solver for incompressible and compressible single-phase flows, scalable to over 100,000 CPU cores and recently extended with GPU support. After a brief look at its modular architecture and latest features this talk presents three industrial case studies: thermal management in data centres, hydrogen dispersion in electrolyser containers, and wind-farm energy prediction. These examples highlight how transparent numerics and reproducible, vendor-neutral workflows accelerate iteration between research and industry. |
| 15:40 | **Closing remarks** <br> *Knud Erik Meyer, DANSIS chairman* |
