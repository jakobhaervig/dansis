## Appetizer

Water is rising, both literally and on the political agenda: On a heating planet, we expect more frequent and violent cloud bursts and more extreme storm surges. How do we most efficiently protect people and property from these threats?

At the same time it is apparent that our past and present approach to the ecosystems in the oceans and fjords is far from sustainable. Also our vital ground water is challenged by present and past pollution.

Knowledge, understanding and modelling of water dynamics are key to reliable solutions to all these challenges. In this DANSIS seminar we dive into this aspect of handling water in the era of environmental and climate crises.

## Programme

| Time  |                        |
| ----- | ---------------------- |
|  09:00  | **Registration and Coffee** |
|  09:30  | **Welcome and presentation of seminar** <br> *Johan Rønby, RUC & STROMNING* |
|  09:45  | **Flooding, hydrology and flood forecasting** <br> *Michael Butts, DMI* <br> In 2022 DMI was appointed as the national authority for flood early warning and hydrological forecasting for Denmark. The “Flooding and Hydrology” unit was established to develop new flood warning services and forecasting products, initially focused on our local and national emergency services. DMI is developing a national flood and hydrological and warning system, combining hydrological, river, ocean and weather models and real-time data to provide timely, accurate and robust flood warnings. The aim is to go beyond our earlier warnings for extreme rainfall (e.g. cloudbursts) and storm surges to provide information of the impacts of extreme weather, i.e. where and when flooding may occur from the sea, from cloudbursts and streams. |
| 10:15 | **Monitoring the water cycles: Sensors and data-analysis** <br> *Malte Skovby Ahm, Dryp* <br> A variety of sensors and computing techniques are taken in use to monitor risks related to flooding and extreme water cycles. Malte will share insights into weather radar, IOT sensors in combination with CFD, Machine Learning, Hydraulic software sensors in sewage technique and distributed monitoring of the water cycle. |
| 10:45 | **Coffee break** |
| 11:00 | **CFD and hydraulic modelling applied to infrastructure handling cloudburst** <br> *Jesper Heick Thyme, HOFOR* <br> For the Copenhagen area, HOFOR is developing infrastructure to protect citizens and assets from cloudburst. <br> Different projects have benefitted from CFD and hydraulic modelling to optimize the designs. Construction loads, deaeration and energy loss were studied at tunnels’ inlet conditions. <br> Pump-arrangement for relief of the recipient, flushing procedure and flow patterns in the emptying arrangement were optimised. |
| 11:30 | **CFD modelling of the Svanemølle stormwater tunnel** <br> *Martin Reinhold , COWI* <br> The Svanemøllens stormwater tunnel design benefited from CFD modelling in the project phase.<br> A deeper insight to the modelling work will be presented. |
| 12:00 | **Lunch break** |
| 13:00 | **CFD Analysis in Wastewater Management: When and Why?** <br> *Frederik Zafiryadis, Aerotak* <br> Meeting demands for cost efficiency and operational reliability in the utility sector requires advanced tools like Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) to model and optimize hydraulic flows in facilities such as pump sumps, aeration tanks, and overflow structures. This presentation highlights Danish projects where CFD has proven instrumental in optimizing wastewater designs, outlining when CFD adds value and when simpler approaches suffice. The goal is to demonstrate how CFD informs design decisions and identifies projects where it has the greatest impact.  |
| 13:30 | **CFD modelling, outlet from hydrogen production as excess temperature and salinity**  <br> *Tony Erik Bergøe, Niras* <br> 
| 14:00 | **Coffee break** |
| 14:20 | **Despite conservative DK-pesticide-regulation, pesticide residues are detected in groundwater – Why?** <br> *Annette E. Rosenbom, Rambøll* <br> EU-regulatory guidelines and models, applied very conservatively in DK, have been set up to predict pesticide related leaching risk from agricultural soils to groundwater. They incorporate key fate processes like sorption and degradation and flow through the variably saturated soil without considering the variation in space and time of fate processes, nor a realistic hydrogeological setting. Could this explain the lack of ability to predict the leaching risk of pesticide residues as revealed via field-scale monitoring results? |
| 14:50 | **Biogeochemical modelling of Danish marine waters** <br> *Anders Chr. Erichsen, DHI* <br> As an important part of setting targets for nutrient reductions to ensure good ecological status, cf. Water Framework Directive, a number of mechanistic hydrodynamic and biogeochemical models have been developed and applied. These models allow for, among other things, the assessment of impacts when neighboring countries reduce their own nutrient input to waters shared with Denmark, and this has led to discussion between stakeholders in Denmark – and an important part of the recent negotiated tri party agreement. This presentation will describe the model developments, application and showcase the essentials behind the Danish River Basin Management Plans 2021-27.|
| 15:20 | **Closing remarks** <br> *Johan Rønby, RUC & STROMNING* |
