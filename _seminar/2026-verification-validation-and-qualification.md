Digital verification is transforming how we design, validate, and certify industrial processes and equipment. Traditionally, verification has relied on physical testing, documentation, and manual procedures, but digital tools now make it possible to demonstrate compliance virtually — faster, safer, and more transparently.

This seminar focuses on digital verification of processes and equipment with emphasis on Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) requirements, certification procedures, and ATmosphères EXplosives (ATEX) compliance. A key theme is the credibility and reliability of using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and other numerical methods in verification and approval processes.

Digital twins and advanced simulations offer great potential to improve understanding of process behavior and support documentation for regulatory approval. However, they also raise new questions: How do we ensure that a simulation is trustworthy? What are the best practices for model validation and uncertainty assessment? And how can digital verification be integrated into established quality systems and certification frameworks?

In this seminar, experts from industry and academia will present experiences, methods, and case studies on digital verification, validation of models, and the use of CFD for compliance documentation. Presentations will highlight how digital verification can reduce time-to-certification, enhance process safety, and improve decision-making.
