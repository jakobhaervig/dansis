Power-to-X involves converting surplus renewable energy into storable and transportable forms, such as hydrogen, synthetic fuels, chemicals and heat. As such Power-to-X technologies are at the forefront of sustainable energy transformation and play a critical role in balancing the future energy systems with multiple fluctuating energy sources.
Many of the challenges in developing Power-to-X technologies rely heavily on advanced fluid dynamics principles. Understanding fluid flow, heat and mass transfer, and the interaction between different phases are essential for optimizing the performance and scalability of Power-to-X systems.

This seminar will offer insights into the latest advancements in Power-to-X technologies, with a focus on the fluid dynamics aspects that are crucial for their development. Experts from academia and industry will share their knowledge on topics such as electrolysis, catalytic processes, system integration and the role of fluid dynamics in enhancing the efficiency and stability of Power-to-X operations.

Note: MAN ES is 5 min. walk from Metro station Enghave Brygge. Car parking requires a permit at MAN ES. Dansis visitors can get a parking permit free of charge at the reception.

## Programme

| Time  |                        |
| ----- | ---------------------- |
|  9:00 | **Registration and Coffee** |
|  9:30 | **Welcome and presentation of seminar** <br> *Simon Matlok, MAN Energy Solutions* |  |
|  9:45 | **Introduction to PtX - with some fluid dynamic perspectives** <br> *Søren Knudsen Kær, European Energy A/S* <br> European Energy is currently finalising the construction of the largest e-methanol facility in Europe at Kassø near Aabenraa in South Denmark. The e-methanol will be supplied to Maersk, Novo Nordisk and Lego to reduce emissions from shipping and to make CO2 negative plastics. The presentation will outline the overall production process of e-methanol and European Energy’s position in the value chain with a background as project developer. Some of the critical design features and how they link to underlying fluid dynamic and thermodynamic considerations will be discussed. In conclusion an outlook of future optimisation opportunities will be given. |
| 10:30 | **Coffee break** |
| 10:50 | **Accelerating alkaline electrolyzer cell development with multiphysics simulations** <br> *Kresten Juel Jensen, Resolvent* <br> In an alkaline electrolyzer cells, different physical phenomena occur at different scales and interact with each other. This results in a highly non-linear and strongly coupled system of equations that must be solved simultaneously. To predict a cell or stack performance, the processes to be modelled must be carefully selected to capture the most relevant phenomena at the scale of interest while minimizing model complexity and simulation time. Such multiphysics models can be developed and offer valuable understanding on how relevant quantities such as velocity, gas, and liquid volume fractions, pressure, flow distribution across the cell manifold, current distribution, temperature, etc., change with operating conditions for a given geometry. Those models can serve as a solid foundation for the optimization of alkaline electrolyzer cells and stacks. |
| 11:15 | **Alkaline water electrolysis: 3D multiphysics modelling** <br> *Ahsan Iqbal, Green Hydrogen Systems* <br> Alkaline water electrolysis has been used in H2 production for many years. In industries, the efficiency of electrolysis process is described by specific energy requirement i.e. kwh of electrical energy used to produce 1kg of H2. Theoretically at high temperatures efficiency of electrolysis is high. However, as of any other technology, AEW has its limitations e.g. use of diaphragm to separate anode and cathode. Diaphragm can only work under certain temperature. Therefore, properties of diaphragm are one of the factors that limits the operating temperature in AWE |
| 11:40 | **Lunch break and visit at MAN ES Research Center** |
| 13:30 | **CFD modeling and  investigation of NH3 synthesis-sorption integration process in multiple porous zones** <br> *Tianbao Gu, AAU Energy, Aalborg University* <br> Sorption-enhanced ammonia (NH₃) synthesis represents a significant advancement in decentralized NH₃ production powered by renewable energy. Aalborg University is developing a pilot-scale NH₃ synthesis-absorption integrated reactor, utilizing alternating layers of catalyst and absorbent to enhance NH₃ production and streamline its separation under moderate conditions. The CFD model that simulates the complex reactions involved in NH₃ synthesis and absorption across multiple porous zones has been developed and validated, by implementing user-defined scalars and correlative expressions. The model then has been deployed to virtually test and optimize the pilot design configuration, as well as to establish workflow to automatically adjust key design parameters, resulting in the model-based reactor configuration and useful tool for automatic design optimization.|
| 13:55 | **Experimental and CFD investigations of flow in electrolyzers** <br> *Casper Schytte Hemmingsen, Stiesdal Hydrogen* <br> Alkaline electrolyzers present interesting and complex problems seen from a fluid dynamics perspective. The flow behavior upstream and downstream of the stack cells significantly influences the performance of the overall unit, and components need to be designed to achieve specific beneficial flow characteristics. This talk introduces design processes and investigations conducted in Stiesdal Hydrogen to optimize performance of the electrolyzer units.  |
| 14:20 | **DANSIS Graduate Award 2024 Ceremony and Presentation**  <br> *Knud Erik Meyer, DANSIS chairman, Denmark* |
| 14:40 | **Coffee break** |
| 15:00 | **CFD, a tool for understanding of flow in electrolyzers** <br> *Pourya Foroogh, Aarhus University* <br> Alkaline water electrolyzers represent a rich physical problem where multiphase fluid flow, mass transfer, and electrochemical reactions are among the contributing factors. CFD is a tool to shed light on the complex physics of the problem and optimize electrolyzer cells. The present talk introduces an on-going simulation campaign at Aarhus University aiming to understand the two-phase flow in alkaline electroyzers with porous electrodes at both cell and micro (pore and bubble) scales and to improve the performance. |
| 15:25 | **CFD combustion modelling of alternative fuels in two-stroke marine engines** <br> *Kar Mun Pang, MAN Energy Solutions* <br> In the last couple of years, MAN Energy Solutions has brought marine two-stroke engines operating on liquefied natural gas, ethane, methanol, and liquefied petroleum gas to the worldwide market. Ammonia-fueled engines are currently development as well. A semi-global approach is implemented to simulate the dual fuel combustion chemistry in these engines, with the aim at achieving a balance between computational efficiency and accuracy. Upon model evaluation, the CFD-chemical kinetic toolbox is used to evaluate new engine concepts, to provide insights on the in-cylinder process and to propose engineering solutions.|
| 15:50 | **Fluid challenges in the Stiesdal SkyClean pyrolysis concept** <br> *Giacomo Butera, Stiesdal SkyClean* <br> SkyClean pyrolysis enables the conversion of agricultural residues into combustible gas, bio-oil and biochar, a porous carbon-rich structure ensuring storage of carbon over hundreds of years. Biochar represents a cheap pathway to capture and store CO2 from the atmosphere, and to reduce the emissions of greenhouse gases from agriculture. Upscaling of SkyClean process is necessary to ensure cost-competitiveness and to commercialize the technology. The upscaling has however resulted in major problems to be solved such as ensuring homogeneous flow in the updraft pyrolysis reactor, handling of tar condensation over surfaces and subsequent clogging of  pipes and equipment, as well as filtration of particle dust. |
| 16:10 | **Closing remarks** <br> *Knud Erik Meyer, DANSIS chairman, Denmark* |
